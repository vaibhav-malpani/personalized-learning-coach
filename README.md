# Personalized Learning Coach ðŸŽ“

A sophisticated multi-agent learning system built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that demonstrates the power of iterative refinement and intelligent tutoring through AI agents.

## Overview

This system creates a personalized learning experience where AI agents work together to:
- Analyze student learning styles and knowledge levels
- Provide tailored explanations and analogies
- Generate assessment questions
- Analyze student responses and iteratively improve teaching approaches
- Maintain encouraging feedback throughout the learning process

## System Architecture

The system consists of 5 specialized AI agents:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Tutor Agent (Orchestrator)**
- Analyzes user learning style and knowledge level
- Coordinates other agents based on student needs
- Adapts teaching strategy based on feedback

### ðŸ“š **Topic Explainer Agent**
- Provides core explanations of complex topics
- Adjusts complexity based on student level
- Focuses on scientific accuracy while maintaining accessibility

### ðŸŒŸ **Analogy Agent**
- Creates age-appropriate metaphors and analogies
- Generates multiple analogy types for different learning styles
- Simplifies complex concepts using familiar examples

### ðŸ¤” **Question Generator Agent**
- Creates assessment questions to check understanding
- Generates mix of multiple choice and open-ended questions
- Provides explanations for correct answers

### ðŸ”„ **Feedback Agent (Loop Controller)**
- Analyzes student responses to determine understanding level
- Controls the learning loop by directing other agents
- Provides encouraging feedback and determines next steps
